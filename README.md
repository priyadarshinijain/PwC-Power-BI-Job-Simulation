# Customer Churn Analysis Project

This project focuses on **customer churn analysis** using Power BI to analyze various factors such as internet services, customer demographics, payment methods, and contracts. The objective is to identify the factors contributing to churn and provide actionable insights to reduce churn rates.

## Problems Identified in the Project

### High Churn Rate (27%)
- **27%** of the customers are leaving the service. A significant portion of this churn is related to:
  - **Month-to-month contracts**: Customers with month-to-month contracts churn more frequently than those with longer contracts.
  - **Payment methods**: Certain payment methods, like electronic checks, are associated with higher churn rates.

### Churn by Contract Type
- The highest churn occurs among **month-to-month contracts (43%)**, which, while flexible, are riskier for retention.
- **Long-term contracts** have lower churn, but fewer customers commit to them.

### Internet Services and Tech Support
- **Fiber optic customers** have the highest number of tech tickets, indicating potential dissatisfaction with service quality, leading to increased churn.
- **DSL users** also report tech issues, but at a lower rate than fiber optic customers.

### Payment Methods Affect Churn
- **Electronic checks** are linked to higher churn rates (45%), while **credit cards** and **automatic bank transfers** show lower churn rates.
- Customers using **automatic payments** are more likely to stay, highlighting the importance of promoting this method.

### Senior Citizens and Partner Status
- **25% of customers** are senior citizens, and they tend to churn more compared to younger users.
- Partners and customers without dependents also contribute to higher churn rates.

## Key Insights and Recommendations

### Promote Automatic Payments
- Aim for a **yearly increase of automatic payments by 5%** to encourage a more consistent and stable payment method, which is associated with lower churn.

### Improve Tech Support for Fiber Optic Customers
- Since fiber optic customers file more tech tickets, improving the quality and capacity of tech support for these users is crucial. The goal is to reduce tech tickets per customer to **0.5**.

### Target Senior Citizens with Retention Strategies
- Develop specific retention strategies for senior citizens, offering personalized support or incentives to reduce churn among this vulnerable group.

### Address Payment Method Preferences
- Focus on customers using **electronic checks** and encourage them to switch to more stable payment methods like **credit cards** or **bank transfers**.
